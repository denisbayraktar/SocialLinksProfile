### What I learned

While working on this project, I grasped a number of important concepts and honed my skills:

- Creating Buttons and Adding Links: I added buttons to the page using HTML and CSS, and linked them to websites.

- Customizing Button Styles: I customized the appearance and behavior of buttons using CSS, adding hover effects and color changes when hovering over them.

- Editing Link Styles: I improved the user experience by removing the underline from links and adding color changes when hovering over them.

- Adding Gradient Background: By using CSS, I added gradient to the background, making the page more visually appealing.

Acquiring these skills has helped me successfully complete the project and enhance my abilities in web design.
